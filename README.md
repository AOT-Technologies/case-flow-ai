## Stepzen Integration    
We integrate Stepzen Inside the caseflow-api folder.
Folder structure will look like below:

![App Screenshot]()

Inside caseflow-poc -> caseflow-api -> caseflow

    - Config.yaml
    - Index.graphql
    - Stepzen.config.json
    - models/

These files are used for stepzen integration

### Config.yml
    
 ![App Screenshot]()

  
Will start the e PostgreSQL server, makes it available on port 5433 .

To make this database available to other services outside your private network, you need to create a TCP tunnel. For this ngrok will be used:

`ngrok tcp 5433`

![App Screenshot](https://github.com/AOT-Technologies/case-flow-ai/blob/staging/development/.images/ngrok.png)

Ngrok will return the forwarding address for the local PostgreSQL database, which will looks something like this: `tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:15650`.

You need to add this to the file  config.yaml and also the postgress dbname,username and password for connection

### stepzen.config.json

![App Screenshot]()

Make sure your current working directory is cd {Your Directory}/caseflow-poc/caseflow-api/caseflow

 #### Run the command in terminal :
