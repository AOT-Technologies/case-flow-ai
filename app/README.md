    5.Stepzen user interface will be available on http://localhost:5001/



- ### caseflow-api(Python Flask Api) 
    You can install it through locally or docker

    Make sure your current working directory is cd {Your Directory}/caseflow-poc/caseflow-api      
    Make sure the following stepzen configurations steps are correct.

   

    1.Copy the stepzen endpoint and update STEPZEN_ENDPOINT_URL in the .env file 

    2.Copy the API Key from stepzen [Account](https://dashboard.stepzen.com/account) and update   STEPZEN_API_KEY  in the .env file

    3.To make this database available to other services outside your private network, you need to create a TCP tunnel. For this ngrok will be used:

    Download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

    Run ngrok 

    ```bash
    ngrok tcp [postgres port number]
    ```

    ![App Screenshot](https://github.com/AOT-Technologies/case-flow-ai/blob/staging/development/.images/ngrok.png)
    

    Ngrok will return the forwarding address for the local PostgreSQL database, which will looks something like this: tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:15650.

    Update base posgres URL with the ngrok URL

    4. make sure the Config.yml file is updated(caseflow-poc -> caseflow-api -> caseflow ->config.yaml)
